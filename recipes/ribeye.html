    <p><strong>Description: </strong>Salting the ribeye steak two days prior to cooking brines the steak, helps tenderize it, and adds rich flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>Six 8 ounce ribeye steaks</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
       <li>1.5 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Salt both sides of steaks with 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt per steak. Place steaks in an airtight 
           container and refrigerate 48 hours. </li>
       <li>Remove steaks from the refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to cooking. Sprinkle both sides of steaks with black pepper. </li>
       <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add vegetable oil; heat until oil shimmers. </li>
       <li>Carefully place steaks in skillet. Cook until brown and hard-seared on one side, 4 to 5 minutes. </li>
       <li>Flip steaks; top with 1 teaspoon butter. Cook until desired doneness, or 3 to 4 minutes more. You may need to cook 
           steaks in batches depending on the size of your cast-iron skillet. Keep cooked steaks in a 170 degrees F 
           ( 77 degrees C) oven until ready to serve. </li>
    </ol>
